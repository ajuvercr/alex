Alex is a project that spiraled totally out of control. It was meant to be a small single weekend project to make it easy to share files over a local network so you could for example run Alex on your NAS and easily up/download files. For example share a file that is to big to send over Facebook or mail, just put it up there and tell your friend, your requested file is ready. Why not just use a flash drive? Ain't nobody got time for that.

There was only one problem, I didn't have time to implement Alex, so what do you need? A scheduler to schedule all your stupid projects + mendatory projects from University. Why not use Alex for that as well? You know a swiss army knife server is always a good idea right? But this is just lame, now you have 2 disjunct portions, and how does one keep track of all his/hers projects? Wouldn't it be great to also keep a detailed log about each project? Like a blog? Sure add it also.

Ok ok, one more problem. When you run Alex on your local NAS, you also want your household members to use it right? What is the point otherwise? So there needs to be authentification. And what about when you are working on a project with 2 persons and you don't want anybody else to read your log about that project? Keep it seperate so you need some kind of divisions everywhere.
